# This module creates monthly revenue forecast lines.

For each calendar month between the start date and end date, a month-revenue is
generated. Go to Reports / Monthly Revenue to see the overview of the expected revenue
per month derived from all the opportunities.

## Steps to generate monthly expected revenue:

- Expected revenue should be filled. Once set the monthly expected revenue fields will
  be visible.
- Then you can fill start date and end date to get splitted revenues per month.
